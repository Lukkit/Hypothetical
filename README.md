# Hypothetical
Hypothetical Lukkit plugins to explore new ideas and create a better development experience 

## Guidelines
Please stick to the following guidelines. Makes it easier for all of us to work with:
 - Include a header comment in each file describing what the file's purpose is (e.g. "Examples for plugin configuration files")
 - Document each line/method as to its purpose (see ``./config/config.lua`` for a good example)
 - If you're describing a method state its purpose, parameters with types, errors (if any), and returns (for a good example see ``./storage/storage.lua``)
 - If you're describing properties of something, explain their default value or if a value is required
 - Break your file into logical sections if you can. Again, see ``./config/config.lua`` for a good example.
